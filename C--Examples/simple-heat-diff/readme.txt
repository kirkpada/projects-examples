Heat differential program which calucalates the heat differential of a metal.

The metals information is passed in via input from a .dat file.

After calculations are complete, the output file can be taken and ran with a program called GrADS.
Using the ouput file with GrADS, it will produce a graphic which shows the heat dispersion on a 1 dimension graph.
